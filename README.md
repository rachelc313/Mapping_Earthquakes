# Mapping_Earthquakes

In this project, we continued our practice in JavaScript by creating an interactive map using mapbox and API's from Site https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php.

The map has three layers and 3 background maps to choose from. 

Backgrounds:
- Streets
- Satellite Streets
- Navigation (Day)

Layers:
- All earthquakes
- Major earthquakes
- Tectonic plates
